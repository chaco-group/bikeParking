Dear ...

We are looking to install a number of Sheffield stands in our car park. 
An overview of the site and where we're planning to put the stands is shown in the map below.

Each of the spaces highlighted with red arrows is in the car park on paving stones with grade separation from the tarmac with paving slabs that could be used to fasten the stands, as shown below.

There are 2 similar spaces between car parking spaces.

Please can you provide quotes for:

-  2 stands in each of the 3 spaces highlighted with red arrows
-  2 stands in just one of the spaces as a trial
-  3 stands in one of the spaces as a trial
